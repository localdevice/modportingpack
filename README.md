This idea was originally brought to light by 2Pi in the video: https://yewtu.be/watch?v=buQUGhM_ufc<br>
All of the programs are pulled from the original sources, but don't detect updates.<br>
This is to avoid any redistribution problems.<br>
I do not claim to own any of the programs that are acquired via this batch file.<br>

Due to Oracle switching to a sign-on system for downloading their JDK, I cannot properly pull the necessary JDK from their website.<br>
To download, you must go to the official website and login with your Oracle account or create an Oracle account.
