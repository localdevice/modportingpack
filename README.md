	All of the programs are pulled from the original sources, but don't detect updates. This is to avoid any
	redistribution problems. I do not claim to own any of the programs that are acquired via this batch file.
	If you need updates, the original links are below:

	Due to Oracle switching to a sign-on system for downloading their JDK, I cannot properly
	pull the necessary JDK from their website. To download, you must go to the official website and login with your Oracle account
	or create an Oracle account.

	If you have questions or are stuck feel free to ask in the comments or contact me via my various
	social medias, I will try to respond to everyone, unless you don't put forth any effort, trust me, it is obvious.
